            <p>The WWE Universe has been eagerly waiting for the highly anticipated rematch between Cody Rhodes and Roman Reigns. After their unforgettable clash at last year’s WrestleMania, where Reigns successfully defended his Undisputed WWE Universal Championship, fans have been demanding a second showdown. Now, with WrestleMania around the corner, the rematch is finally happening.</p>
            
            <p>Cody Rhodes has been on a relentless quest to finish his story. Ever since returning to WWE, he has made it clear that winning the championship his father never held is his ultimate goal. Despite falling short in their first encounter, Rhodes has continued to build momentum, winning the Royal Rumble and earning another shot at dethroning The Tribal Chief. His resilience, passion, and connection with the fans have made him one of the most beloved superstars in WWE today.</p>
            
            <p>On the other side stands Roman Reigns, the most dominant champion of the modern era. Holding the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship for over 1,200 days, Reigns has proven time and time again why he is the Head of the Table. With The Bloodline backing him up, he has managed to overcome every challenger who has stepped up, but Cody Rhodes represents a different kind of threat. Unlike other competitors, Rhodes isn’t just fighting for the title—he’s fighting for his family’s legacy.</p>
            
            <p>This rematch carries even more weight than the first encounter. With Reigns’ reign approaching legendary status and Rhodes determined to finish his journey, the stakes have never been higher. Will Cody finally achieve his lifelong dream and dethrone The Tribal Chief, or will Roman Reigns continue his historic dominance? One thing is certain—this match is bound to be an instant classic.</p>
